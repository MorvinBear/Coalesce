# Converge-19

Peter wants to attend or host a Game Night, but only with a small group of people. 

Peter goes to their Converge-19 app and checks the local listings of possible convergences and sees a possibility of a Game Night. Reading over the details of the Game Night Possibility, Peter submits their own criteria for attending, what roles they could play and how many people they would like to play with. 

Once enough people accept the possibility of the Game Night with matching criteria, a notification goes out to let the people that meet the criteria know that a Game Night is possible. If everyone accepts the possibility, the Game Night Converges. 

If someone is unavailable and the criteria are no longer met, the Game Night doesn't happen yet, the group is notified that it won't work this time and the group will be waiting for the criteria to be met again.
